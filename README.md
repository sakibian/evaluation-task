We are running a short 3-day test phase to evaluate developers for a potential long-term collaboration.

This test is mandatory for us before starting any ongoing projects.

Test task (prototype only – not a final product):

Build a simple functional prototype with the following flow:
• A small landing page
• The user must leave a review (simple text input, no real API or database required)
• After submitting the review, the user gains access to a roulette wheel
• The roulette randomly displays “Win” or “Lose”

Purpose of this test:

We are not evaluating design perfection.
We want to assess:
• Logic & structure
• User flow
• Basic front-end implementation
• Ability to follow instructions
• Clean and understandable code

Important notes:
• No payment system
• No advanced security
• No real backend required
• Simple UI is totally fine
• This is only a proof of concept

If you are selected after this test, we will move forward with long-term projects (business websites, booking systems, landing pages, etc.).

Please confirm if you understand the task and can complete it within 3 days.

Looking forward to working with you.
